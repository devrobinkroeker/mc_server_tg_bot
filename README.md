# mc_server_tg_bot
Controls a minecraft server docker container through a telegram bot. [This](https://hub.docker.com/r/itzg/minecraft-server) is the minecraft server docker image. The idea is to run this bot on your server where your minecraft docker container is also running.

Run the bot like so: `./bot.py <minecraft_container_name>`
